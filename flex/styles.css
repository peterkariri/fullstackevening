css>>stands for cascanding stlye sheet which is used to give style
 (color,animation,font,backgroundmanipulation,transitions) to html tags using selectors

 css can be classified into three main categories:
 inline css:styles are implemente directly in the html tag 
 embedded/internal css:this css is embeded in the html documnet and linked in the head.(done using styles tag)
 in this two above they are excecuted sequentially
 external css:used externally and referred as a link in the head section:executed simultaneously 

 css makes styling possible by use of selector
 selectors are of different types in regard to the type of tag they target
 types of seletors 
 id selectors:are used to uniquely stype a particular element (#one)
 class selectors:used to style an element or a group of element belonging to the same class(.child-1)
 element /general selectors/tag selectors selectors:are used to style  common tags (p)
 type selectors:they are used to style attributes (type[value=""]{})
 universal selector(selecst everything in the webpage :denoted by the astric symbol(*))
 advances level 
 psuedoclass selectors(:nth-last-child(),:nth-child(),:nth-last-of-type(),:nth-of-type())
 immediate child seletor:selects the immediate child in a particular structur (nav>li:targets only the 
 first li and keaves the other li)
 sibling selector : nav li(selects all the li in the navigation )

 adjacent child selector:selects the elements in the adjacent tags (~)

 css structure:block>enclosed in curly brackets,selectors,property,value
inside the block css has a syntax where every property is separated from the other using a semicolon 
 h1>>selector{
    color>>property
    :red;>>value
 }
 css is executed in three ways:cascade>>execute line by line,specificity(inline css,id),!important(brings
  parmanet changes such that even if you the same selector to a
  particular tag more than 1000 times as long as it has the important keyword it does not change)

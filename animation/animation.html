keyframes are breakpoints that enhance or facilitates animations in css
the do this using two methods:
the FROM .......TO keyword(the beginning of the animation and the end)
and the PERCENTAGES(0%>>>100%)offers more flexibility as you can decide what to do at 
differents percentages 

animation is declared such that the element containing the animation is goiven the animaton name 
the animation is then called on the element using the animation name

the name of the keyframe should be the name of the anoimation 


the name ot the keyframe should be th ename of the animation and the animation property
and values should be inside the element/tag they target.
